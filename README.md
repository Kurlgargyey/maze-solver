# maze-solver

This guided project was about writing a program to display a maze and then solve it using a depth-first, recursive approach.

It was fun to see such a short program generate a graphical representation. It was challenging to try and write comprehensive test cases for my code.

If I revisit this, I would like to implement a button to reset the program without having to restart it, and I would like to add options for the algorithm to be used or different maze sizes.
